# Hackpad

## Overview
This is a limited-time YSWS where *you* can get your own customized macropad, for free! Here's how it goes:

**You ship**:
- A complete PCB design
- A 3D model for a case
- Compiled firmware for the device

**We ship**:
- 3 PCBs! Keep one for yourself, share them with your friends!
- Your case, 3D printed here at HQ!
- All the components needed for your macropad, including:
    - Switches
    - Diodes
    - A XIAO RP2040
    - Whatever else you may add! (within reason)

That's it! Only additional requirement is that your macropad be meaningful distinct. For example, a plain 4x4 macropad with no decor, layout change, or custom components will NOT be accepted.

## This is great, how do I make one?

Glad you asked! Here are some pretty useful guides:

- [How a Keyboard Matrix Works](https://docs.qmk.fm/how_a_matrix_works)
- [Rollover, blocking and ghosting](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Rollover,_blocking_and_ghosting)
- ADDMORE

## Anything else?

Will do! WIP for now
