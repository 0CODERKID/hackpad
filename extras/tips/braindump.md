# Braindump

Here lies a braindump of everything useful I've picked up over the years. Will add more as I think of stuff



## The good stuff
- Software I use // recommend:
    - CAD: Fusion360, Onshape
    - PCB Design: KiCad. Hands down.
    - Firmware: VSCode, but really doesn't matter
- **Use https://kbatelier.org/, especially their discord. #1 TIP HERE**
- Heatset inserts are a great way to fasten your print. Use 4.7mm diameter holes for the cavity, and then 3.4mm holes for the screws. I use [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800046543591.html) ones made for 3D printed parts, picked it up from the VORONDesign sourcing guide.
- Sketch out your design before making it. Helps a ton with being clear on what to do
- [Keyboard mount styles](https://www.keyboard.university/200-courses/keyboard-mounting-styles-4lpp7)
- Generate your plates with [KLE (Keyboard layout editor)](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) and [ai03's plate generator](https://kbplate.ai03.com/)

## Misc stuff
- Instead of using Kailh hotswap sockets, you can use millmax ones instead. They fit directly into regular Cherry MX switch footprints, and they actually work pretty well! I can do them for you. Example https://mech.land/products/mill-max-sockets

- If you have a low # of switches, avoid the matrix and just wire directly to the microcontroller
